# build-content-scraper

###Instruction

Imagine you work at a price comparison website. Youâ€™ve been given the task to create a Node.js command line application that goes to an ecommerce site to get the latest prices and save them to a spreadsheet (CSV format). This spreadsheet will be used by another application to populate a database. The application you build will be run once every day. To complete this project, you'll need to research and use npm packages that will help you scrape a website and create a CSV file.

### I used below two packages:

####x-ray
https://www.npmjs.com/package/x-ray

1.This package has 26 contributors, and latest update on 29 days ago, it's still active.<br>
2.Its syntax straightforward using css selector.<br>
3.The API is entirely composable, giving you great flexibility in how you scrape each page.<br>
4.In the last month, it has been downloaded 4430 times.<br>

####json2csv
https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2csv

1.Converts json into csv with column titles and proper line endings, this does exactly what I needed.<br>
2.It's so popuplar, 122,748 download in the last month.<br>
3.Latest update is 17 days ago, also it has 33 contributors.<br>
4.The syntax is straightforward and easy to understand.<br>
